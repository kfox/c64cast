"""Shared guarded mido import + MIDI input-port resolution.

mido (+ python-rtmidi) is the optional `midi` extra, so every MIDI consumer
(midi_scene, asid_scene, midi_control) needs the same try/except import
guard — one copy lives here. `mido` is typed as Any so Pyright doesn't flag
mido.* as attributes of None (and doesn't miss open_input/get_input_names
through stubs); `MIDI_AVAILABLE` is the runtime guard callers check before
touching it. `open_input_port` is the shared input-port resolver behind each
consumer's `_open_port`. Consumers re-import `mido` under their own module
name, so patching `<consumer>.mido` still works for code in that module —
but port *resolution* reads this module's `mido`, so tests faking ports
patch `c64cast._midi.mido`.
